## About Me

I am a frontend developer with a focus on creating beautiful, intuitive, and responsive web applications. My tech stack includes React ⚛️, TailwindCSS 🎨, and Bootstrap 🧪, and I am always learning and expanding my skills. Currently, I am exploring React Native 📱 and its potential in app development.

## Fun Fact

Many people believe that luck determines our fate, but I have a different perspective. I firmly believe that our actions, choices, and hard work play a significant role in shaping our destinies.✨
